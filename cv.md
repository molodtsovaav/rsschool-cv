##**Summary**
Hello! My name is Anastasia and I really want to become a front-end developer. I am 28 years old. I am an economist by education. 
 I graduated from school and university with an excellent certificate. I really love math. Now I realized that I want to learn programming. I took the http://rubyschool.us/ programming course, I studied SQL, QA/development theory. Now I work as a QA and study JS in parallel.
